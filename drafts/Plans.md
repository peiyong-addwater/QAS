# Next Step for Current Tree Search Based Quantum Ansatz Search Project

## Motivation

- Make the life easier for people who do not has a good insight or heuristic of the structure of the variational ansatz.

## Where We Are:
- It is easy to reach the encoding circuit for the bit-flip and phase-filp code;
- Toffoli decomposition with five two-qubit gates (two CNOTs and three CRots) is partially successful. The reason that it's not completely successful probably lies in that we cannot treat this problem in a machine learning fashion (train the circuit with a bunch of input states and corresponding target states generated by the Toffoli gate).
- Haven't been able to reach the [[4,2,2]] code or the [[5,1,3]] code with previous versions (Qiskit based) of the implementation.
- Running time has been greatly reduced with the new pennylane based implementation, most because of the speed to calculate the gradients.

## Next Step for the Paper

- Tasks in the SCB paper, which is prepare a single logical $|+\rangle$ or $|-\rangle$ logical state of the [[5,1,3]] code and/or the Stean code. The benifit of this task is that SCB already gave a good defination of the cost/reward function with a Hamiltonian composed of the stabilizers $g_i$ and the target logical state $|\Phi\rangle_{L}=\alpha|0\rangle_{L}+\beta|1\rangle_{L}$:

$$
H=-\frac{1}{n}\left(\sum_{i} g_{i}+O_{L}\right)
$$
$$
O_{L} =|\Phi\rangle_{L}\langle\Phi|_{L}-\mid \Phi\rangle_{L}^{\perp}\langle\Phi|_{L} ^{\perp}\\
= \left(\alpha \beta^{*}+\alpha^{*} \beta\right) X_{L}-i\left(\alpha^{*} \beta-\alpha \beta^{*}\right) Y_{L}-\left(\beta \beta^{*}-\alpha \alpha^{*}\right) Z_{L}
$$
$$
O_{L}|\Phi\rangle_{L}=|\Phi\rangle_{L}
$$
- The four-qubit version of $H_2$ simulation. The reason we'll choose the four-qubit version is that the optimnized two-qubit version with the B-K transformation is too simple.

- A machine learning task, like a variational classifier with the Iris dataset.
- A QAOA task.
- Currently the operations that the search algorithm can choose from are only basic gates like the single qubit rotation gates, CNOT gates and CRot controlled rotation gates. This is fine for small scale circuits. However if we want to apply the search algorithm to larger problems, like the variational simulation of LiH, we'll need to changle the operations to single-qubit rotation layers and two-qubit entanglement layers.
